	The construction works shall be carried out under the following conditions; 
	<ol>
       <li  style=" text-align: justify;">
			   The construction shall be in line with the approved drawings submitted to 
			   the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority and in accordance with relevant provisions of Petroleum 
			   Regulations.
	   </li>
       <li  style="; text-align: justify;">
			   All impact mitigation/monitoring measures as provided in the Environmental Impact Assessment (E.I.A) 
			   report and as indicated in the Environmental Management Plan are comprehensively implemented during the 
			   construction and operation phases. 

		</li>
       <li  style=" text-align: justify;">
			The company should actively work with the NMDPRA staff to be attached to the project and officially inform the 
			Department of each milestone, particularly pipeline laying, tank/pipeline hydro-tests, and calibration exercises. 
			The name of the Staff will be communicated to you by our {5} office. 
	   
	   </li>
       <li  style=" text-align: justify;">
			All petroleum Products dispensing meters, pumps and cargo pumps shall be subjected to Factory Acceptance Tests (FAT) witnessed by NMDPRA. It is mandatory to involve the Department on the specifications of these equipment prior to purchase. 

		</li>

	  <li style=" text-align: justify;"> 
			All cargo pipelines MUST be fitted with adequate Pressure and flow monitoring devices. 
	  </li>
	  <li style=" text-align: justify; page-break-inside:avoid"> 
		  At the completion of the project, a detailed operational safety case study shall be carried out by a NMDPRA accredited 
		  consultant and submit a copy of the report to the Department before commissioning the facility.
	  </li>
	  <li style=" text-align: justify; page-break-inside:avoid">

   In addition to the above, NMDPRA representatives will periodically visit the site to monitor the construction work and to ensure that 
   all standards are maintained. 

 
</p>
<p style=" text-align: justify; page-break-inside:avoid">
	You are therefore requested to strictly adhere to the above as the issuance of an operating license for the facility will be dependent on total compliance.
